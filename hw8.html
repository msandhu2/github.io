        1. The most attractive feature of XQuery is that it is a language that was 
        developed to extract data not only from XML files, but also relational 
        databases and other non XML formats. Furthermore, XQuery can be used to 
        merge data from multiple sources by using a language that is fairly easy 
        to use if you are familiar with XPath syntax. A major con that has been 
        sited about XQuery is that vendors solutions are often incompatible 
        and thus cannot be reused in other environments. Thus, code is only usable
        in the project and or organization it was developed in. Another con is that 
        XQuery is not hierarchial, eventhough XML is hierarchial.

        2. I suggest that we leverage the skills I've learned in XML class to
        track our IS expenditures during COVID using XQuery to analyze the data 
        contained in the AssetManager application. After all, AssetManager stores 
        data in a relational database and XQuery can be used to calculate the
        organizations spending for the Work from Home Program. We can determine 
        the amount of money spent on monitors, computers, laptops, and other 
        peripherals. As an example, the XQuery code below is used to list all books 
        that cost less than $30 from the hw8.xml file. This is just a sample of the 
        syntax, but the code for my IT department would have more complex formulas
        to track project spending and track location of company assets.
      </p>

      <blockquote><pre><code>
        xquery version "1.0"; 
        for $b in doc("hw8.xml")/bookstore/book where
        $b/price < 30 return $b/title
      </code></pre></blockquote>

      <p>
        Using XQuery, we can query AssetManager to see how many laptops,
        monitors, docking stations, Arubas, etc were deployed per region for the
        Work From Home project. XQuery saves the data in an XML formated file
        that stores well and can easily be rendered on our intranet site,
        Sharepoint, Teams, and more.
      </p>

        3. Introducing XQIB which is an acronym that stands for XQuery in the
        Browser. XQIB is a library used to code client-side web applications by
        expanding Javascript with many useful functions.
